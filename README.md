This is a social media dashboard bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) demonstrating an implementation of postgreSQL and Redis (NoSQL). It currently uses Supabase, Redis, NextJS, Tailwind, and Shadcn + Lucide for styling.

API keys will only be provided via private channels (such as email).

```npm install```
```npm run dev```

Realtime was originally implemented but eventually scrapped (just commented out) as it wasn't intended to be used frequently by multiple users
